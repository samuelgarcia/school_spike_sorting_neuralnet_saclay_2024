This hands-on tutorial will demonstrate getting a premade probe, making your own probe and mapping it to a recording, and demonstrate how a probe slices a recording.
You will see how to use probeinterface and probeinterface.plotting as well as pandas dataframes to understand the spatial organization of your data.
