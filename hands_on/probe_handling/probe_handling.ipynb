    "probeinterface is a tool to handle the design of the probe layout, that will be used by all modern spike sorting algorithms. Indeed, since spike sorters are making use of the spatial positions of the channels to reconstruct the extracellular waveforms elicited during the spike of a single cell, it is crucial to know where channels are located. If you are lucky, then such a probe layout is already available, and you can use it instantaneously (e.g. `spikeinterface.extractors.read_spikeglx()`). But most of the time, depending on your recording setup/probe, you need to create one. In such a file, you must specify what your channels are, where they are in space, and what is the mapping between your recording file and the recording setup.\n",
